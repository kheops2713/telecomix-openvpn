This small package contains three OpenVPN sample config files,
one Stunnel sample config file and a root certificate used on
the WNH darknet.

OpenVPN config files are respectively designed for the
following type of connection:
- direct connection to an OpenVPN server
- connection through stunnel (provides SSL encapsulation)
- connection through Obfsproxy (obfsuscates the traffic), or
  any other locally installed SOCKS proxy (can be Tor as well)
